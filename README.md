# WinFormsProyectoFinal2021
This is my final proyect of my penultime year in highschool. It is just a WinForms CRUD application that interacts with a MySQL database.
It includes forms about the CRUD operations, reports using ReportViewer.
It is written in c# and runs on Visual Studio and the .net platform.
If you want to create one you'll need some runtimes, addons and many thing more like the mysql dotnet connector, the report viewer component, etc...
