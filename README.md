# WinFormsProyectoFinal2021
This is my final proyect of my penultime year in highschool. It is just a WinForms CRUD application that interacts with a MySQL database.
It includes forms about the CRUD operations, reports using ReportViewer.
It is written in c# and runs on Visual Studio and the .net platform.
If you want to create one you'll need some runtimes, addons and many thing more like the mysql dotnet connector, the report viewer component, etc...

## Proyect and file explanation:
- The .cs files contains the code I wrote for the proyect
- The .rdlc files are the files that report viewer use to the represent the record.
- The .cs files with the [design] label are the files of the graphic user interface.
